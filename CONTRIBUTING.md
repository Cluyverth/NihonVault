# Contributing to NihonVault

Thank you for your interest in contributing to **NihonVault**! This project is a collaborative knowledge base for aspiring exchange students and workers in Japan, and we welcome your input. To ensure consistency across the repository, please follow the guidelines below when adding new pages or editing existing ones.

---

## üìù General Guidelines

1. **Use Standard Obsidian Titles:**  
   When adding new content, always use Obsidian's standard heading format (`#`, `##`, `###`, etc.) for titles. The main title of the page should always be a level 1 header (`#`), and subsections should use level 2 (`##`) or level 3 (`###`) headers as needed. This ensures compatibility with Obsidian as well as other Markdown editors.

   **Example:**
   ```markdown
   # Title of Your Page
   ## Subsection Title
   ### Further Subsection Title
   ```

2. **Link Pages Correctly:**  
   To connect different pages within the Vault and ensure the graph view remains organized, always use Obsidian-style links to refer to other pages. This helps maintain proper relationships between pages and keeps everything interconnected in the graph. Use double square brackets `[[ ]]` to create internal links.

   **Example 1:**
   ```markdown
   For more information, check out the page on [[Japanese Language Schools]].
   ```

   **Example 2:**
   ```markdown
   About what is said in [[Japanese Language Schools]].
   ```

3. **Don't Edit Others' Pages:**  
   When contributing, avoid directly editing the content of pages created by other users. If you need to add something to an existing page, please create a new page and link to it.
   This ensures that each contributor's work remains intact and doesn't overwrite or conflict with others' contributions.
4. **Comment on Topics Using Markup:**  
   If you're contributing to a topic or adding commentary, make sure to use appropriate Markdown syntax to structure your text. This includes using bold (bold), italics (italics), bullet points (-), numbered lists (1.), and other Markdown elements to make your contributions clear and easy to read.

   You can add comments to other contributors' pages, but please make sure to format them in italics at the end of the paragraph you wish to comment on. In addition, provide a brief summary or key point (a few words or sentences) that correlates with the page you created about the topic, along with a link to that page. This helps keep the discussion organized and allows others to follow your thoughts.

   **Example:**
   ```markdown
   This paragraph discusses important details. *Note: Changes to the law regarding work visas were made on 01-06-2024. For more details, check out [[Japanese Work Visas]].*
   ```

## üìÇ Template for Pages
To maintain consistency across the repository, please use the provided template for creating new pages. The template is located in the `/NihonVault/config/templates/` folder.

**How to Use the Template:**

1. Use Obsidian's Insert Template shortcut (Ctrl+T or Cmd+T, depending on your system) to access and insert the available templates directly into your page.
2. Choose the template that best fits the topic you're creating.
3. The template will automatically be inserted into your page. Edit the page by replacing the placeholder text with your own content while maintaining the structure provided in the template.

The templates will help you get started quickly and ensure your page follows the correct format.

**Creating New Templates:**

If you'd like to create a new template, feel free to do so! However, make sure to follow these guidelines:

- The new template must be added to the `/NihonVault/config/templates/` folder.
- The title of the template should be very clear, indicating its intended use. This will help others know when and how to use it.
- Maintain a well-structured layout in the template to ensure that it can be easily followed by other contributors.

By adding your template with a clear description and structure, you help ensure the repository remains organized and easy to navigate.

## üõ†Ô∏è Plugins & Formatting

We recommend using only Obsidian‚Äôs core plugins and the community plugins already used in the project for basic formatting and additional features.
When formatting your page, stick to the standard Obsidian setup to ensure compatibility. If a page requires specific formatting or plugins, ensure they are within the approved set used by the repository.

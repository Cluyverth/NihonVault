## üìñ About the Project

The goal of **NihonVault** is to be a "vault" of knowledge for:
- Understanding the requirements and processes for exchange programs to Japan.
- Exploring study, living, and work options in the country.
- Sharing experiences and learning from the community.

This repository uses the **Obsidian Vault** format for easy navigation and collaborative contribution.  
Since the files are in `.md` (Markdown) format, you can use them with other markdown editors if preferred, but Obsidian serves as the base for this repository.
